                                to suggest itinerary/day plans based on activity proximity or personalized preferences,

                    <p>Before I could dive into my research, I established the proto-persona displayed above, Daniella
                        Simmons, to identify who I believe I am trying to help. In this case, I believe I am trying to
                        help someone whose plans are affected by situational factors.</p>
                    <p>From there, I established my project’s User Research Plan to focus my goal, research questions,
                        and interview questions on how a user plans their vacation by the day and how they respond to
                        dynamic, situational changes when creating their day plans.</p>
                    <p>Five people were involved in the interview process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two females and three males.</li>
                        <li> The interviewees’ ages ranged from 21-60 years old.</li>
                        <li>Each interviewee has been selected based on their range of experience with traveling and
                            planning trips.</li>

                    </p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>Once I transcribed the interview audio to a spreadsheet, I was able to compile the following
                        affinity chart to identify key groupings when it came to planning a trip and existing pain
                        points when it came to locating and shifting overall day travel plans: </p>

            <div class=col-12>

                <p>Based on the findings, one of the major pain points that I identified was how <b>location</b>,
                    <b>time</b>, and <b>cost</b> are some of the key influences when trying to determine how much one
                    can do within a day (especially during a “daycation”) . Based on that concept, I was able to define
                    a new persona, Liam Kingston, as well as his goals and pain points through the following persona
                    card:

                    <p>After assessing my research further, the concepts of time required to experience places within a
                        day and the user’s location proximity to the beginning and/or end location were identified as
                        the factors I wanted to help users with when planning a day trip; especially since users will
                        almost always establish their day itineraries based on those factors regardless of the type of
                        trip they’re taking. From there, I was able to identify the following User Insight Statement and

                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Planning with accessibility and testing with users of all ages and experiences can truly
                            make an impact on your final product.</li>
                        <li>At the beginning, I thought I’d take more situational aspects into account and could fit
                            many ideas into one case study, but you’ve got to start somewhere; start with one big pain
                            point that you can help users with, and expand from there wherever needed.</li>
                        <li>The beginning assumptions may not always be the same as the end result. Users are the key to
                            making that determination.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5><u>POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE ITERATIONS:</u></h5>
                    <p>Although I focused on proximity when it came to location, I think the application itself could
                        also focus on these other topics, if provided the time and resources:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A question specifying how many hours you’d like to spend touring within the day (in this
                            case study, I left that up to the user based on proximity).</li>
                        <li>A feature that highlighted weather as a question or a filter.</li>
                        <li>An emphasis that this app doesn’t only have to be AI or manually self-created, but users CAN
                            view the itineraries of other users, rate them, comment on them, and so forth.</li>
                        <li>Word of mouth was a huge factor that was mentioned during user interviews that didn’t get
                            the chance to shine (yet).</li>
                    </ul>
